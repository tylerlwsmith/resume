# Resume

This repo contains my resume that I send to prospective employers. It is also a mobile responsive website that uses semantic HTML. The project uses several media queries for screen and print that allow it to serve both of these purposes well.

You can check it out at [raspberrytyler.com](https://raspberrytyler.com/). If you're visiting from a desktop device, click the print button to preview how the resume looks when printed.
